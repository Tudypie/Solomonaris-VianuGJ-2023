      of Solomonari. Although I don't know how you could trigger this event. Also,
      obtaining this plant is no easy task.

    line: To obtain Planta Fiarelor, you must venture deep into the forest. Find
      some baby hedgehogs, and carefully lock them in a cage. Then, patiently await
      the arrival of the hedgehogs' mother. It will find the plant and try to unlock
      the cage with it. Seize that opportunity and acquire the plant while expressing
      gratitude by unlocking the babies yourself.
